# Array Methods Practice

This repository provides practice questions to help users become familiar with JavaScript array methods. The exercises are based on an array of user account objects, each representing a user with properties such as `id`, `name`, `email`, `age`, `balance`, and `isActive`.

## Sample Data

Here is the sample data you will use for the exercises:

```javascript
const users = [
  { id: 1, name: "Alice", email: "alice@example.com", age: 28, balance: 5000, isActive: true },
  { id: 2, name: "Bob", email: "bob@example.com", age: 34, balance: 3000, isActive: false },
  { id: 3, name: "Charlie", email: "charlie@example.com", age: 22, balance: 7000, isActive: true },
  { id: 4, name: "Diana", email: "diana@example.com", age: 29, balance: 4000, isActive: false },
  { id: 5, name: "Eve", email: "eve@example.com", age: 35, balance: 10000, isActive: true },
];
